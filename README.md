# First Video Game

This repository contains a starter Godot 4 project for a simple 2D platformer prototype.

## Prerequisites

- [Godot Engine 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download) or any later 4.x release

## Getting Started

1. Launch the Godot editor.
2. In the project manager, choose **Import**, browse to this repository's root directory, and open the `project.godot` file.
3. Once the project loads, open `scenes/Main.tscn`.
4. Press the **Play** button (or hit <kbd>F5</kbd>) to run the placeholder scene. You should see a window displaying the "Platformer" label.

## Project Structure

```
assets/       # Artwork, sprites, and visual assets

environment/  # Environment resources (default world settings)
scenes/       # Scene files

This layout provides a baseline organization for expanding the project into a fully featured platformer.
